## MGET

I started developing some helper functions to enable communication between R and ArcGIS (ArcRstats) for teaching Conservation GIS at Duke with Dr. Patrick Halpin, and Jason Roberts has subsequently developed the robust [Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools](http://mgel.env.duke.edu/mget) ([Roberts, Best et al 2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815210000885)).

## Ocean Health Index

For the [**Ocean Health Index**](http://ohi-science.org/), I developed the back end data infrastructure and front end visualizations for global and subcountry portals, all using open-source software (ie R) and free web services (ie Github).
