I am an environmental data scientist with a strong background in marine spatial ecology. I am currently offering consulting services and most recently lectured at UC Santa Barbara's [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/). I was the senior analyst for the [Ocean Health Index](http://ohi-science.org), a research project housed at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). I recently completed a PhD at Duke University in the [Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab](http://mgel.env.duke.edu). I worked on [Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools](http://mgel.env.duke.edu/mget), [OBIS-SEAMAP](http://seamap.env.duke.edu/) marine animal observation geoportal, [Census of Marine Life Map & Viz](http://comlmaps.org/) and [predictive distribution modeling of cetaceans](http://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/Duke-EC-GOM-2015/).
