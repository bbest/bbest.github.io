Welcome! As an environmental data scientist I offer services to creatively solve environmental problems with cutting edge data science technologies.

## Mission Statement

Support transparent environmental decision-making that promotes open data and analysis along with rich interactive visualizations that enable users high level views of complex problems as well as deep dives into underpinnings.

## Data Science

I am a fan of the data science process as outlined by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/):

`r img(src="images/r4ds_data-science.png", width=400)`

Usually most of the work in modeling is at the data preparation and interpretation stages, ie before and after modeling. I'm an advocate of efficient data ingestion (estimated [50-80%spent on collection and preparation of data](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0)), the iterative process of [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) and closing the gap between the starting with a question and sharing analytical results online and interactively to any audience.
