Welcome! As an Environmental Data Scientist I offer services to creatively solve environmental problems with cutting edge data science technologies.

## Mission Statement

Support comprehensive, transparent environmental decision-making promoting open data, open science and data rich interactive visualizations that enable users synoptic views of complex problems as well as deep dives into underpinnings.

## Data Science

In the spirit of exploratory data analysis upon which R was founded, I am a fan of the data science process as outlined by Hadley Wickham:
